# UtilityBatchScripts
Some helpful batch scripts for windows.


### JunkCleaner.bat
Its so annoying to delete a lot of junk files one by one regularly in windows. This script is a one click solution for it.  
It will remove all the files of the following directories parmanently:  
```
%SYSTEMDRIVE%\$Recycle.bin
%TEMP%
%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Windows\Temp
%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Windows\Prefetch
%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
```
*Most of these files are useless temporary files generated by the system. But make sure if there is any risk in your case
Also it is recommended to run this atleast after an interval of one week and the best time is after a reboot.*  
**Note that running this script with admin permission will make it able to clean up more.**
